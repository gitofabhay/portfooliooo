        <h1>How I Learn</h1> 
        <p>
            I'm not your typical bookworm or workaholic—learning for me is all about the excitement of building something. Take web development, for example. My motivation isn't just to learn code; it's about creating something big, like a crazy social media platform. So I learn by doing. I start building, and as I go, I pick up the pieces I need to get it right. That’s how I roll: follow the 'learn while building' vibe, get it done, and then fine-tune it to make it even better.

            <h2>AI Advancement: Boon or Bane? The Future of Technology and Humanity</h2> <hr>
            <p>The rapid development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has brought forth both excitement and concern. With innovations in machine learning, natural language processing, and robotics, AI promises to revolutionize industries such as healthcare, finance, and transportation. However, with this advancement also comes the fear of job losses, privacy invasion, and even existential threats.</p>
            <p>The debate over whether AI is a threat or a benefit is ongoing. Supporters argue that AI will enhance human capabilities, improve decision-making, and solve some of the world's biggest challenges, like climate change and disease. On the other hand, critics worry about AI surpassing human intelligence, leading to unforeseen consequences, such as autonomous weapons or surveillance states.</p>
            <p>As we venture deeper into this technological age, society must find a balance between leveraging AI's potential while ensuring its ethical use. The key question remains: Is AI a tool that will elevate humanity or will it become a danger we cannot control?</p>

            <h2>The Future of Generative AI: Beyond Sora – What’s Next?</h2> <hr>
            <p>Generative AI has taken the world by storm, with technologies like GPT-3, DALL-E, and recently Sora pushing the boundaries of creativity and automation. These AI systems have demonstrated remarkable abilities in writing, art generation, and even coding. However, the real question that many are asking is: what comes after Sora?</p>
            <p>As AI models grow more powerful, they are becoming increasingly adept at not just mimicking human creativity but also offering novel solutions to complex problems. Future advancements in generative AI could lead to systems capable of advanced reasoning, personalized content creation, and deeper human-computer interaction.</p>
            <p>The next step will likely involve not just more powerful algorithms, but also better models that can understand and align with human values. As generative AI matures, we may see AI-driven applications in education, entertainment, and scientific research, pushing the limits of what we can achieve as a society. But as we move forward, it is crucial to consider the ethical implications of such powerful tools and ensure they serve humanity's best interests.</p>

            <h2>Probability vs Possibility: The Moon Crash – Is the Risk Really 50%?</h2><hr>
            <p>When we consider life’s uncertainties, it’s easy to become fixated on improbable scenarios – like being struck by a moon crash. While the idea of the moon crashing into Earth sounds like something out of science fiction, people often throw around the 50% probability, which raises the question: Is this probability even close to reality?</p>
            <p>The concepts of "probability" and "possibility" are frequently misunderstood. Probability refers to the likelihood of an event occurring based on statistical evidence, while possibility simply denotes whether an event can happen at all. In the case of a moon crash, the probability is astronomically low. The moon is drifting away from Earth, not towards it, at a rate of about 3.8 centimeters per year. Thus, the risk of it crashing into Earth anytime soon is essentially zero.</p>
            <p>While it's fun to entertain such wild ideas, understanding the distinction between possibility and probability is crucial. The probability of unusual events, like a moon crash, is almost negligible, but as with any aspect of life, we need to apply scientific reasoning rather than fear or sensationalism to evaluate real-world risks.</p>
